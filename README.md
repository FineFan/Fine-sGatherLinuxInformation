Fine-sGatherLinuxInformation
============================

This is a script that could running under the RPM based Unix-Like OS. to gathering the Hardware information and the OS information


Usage:<br/>
    copy the GatherSysInfo.sh to your system and running it .<br/>

Why I wrote this:<br/>
    I write this because one of my colleague are leaving his job and will hand over some servers to me which I never touched them before they going to the front line to service us.That means I dont know what the hardware information and the OS information, I got the device list but it is a little brief for me.I have searched the tools which could collect the useful information for me on the Internet but they are all not what I wanted so I wrote this script. I wonder a script that give me all the brief information for these servers,like : <br/>
    Hard Ware Information Brief:<br/>
    manufacturer,Serial Number,CPU,Memory,HardDisk,MainBoard,Power Supple.<br/>
    <br/>
    OS Information:<br/>
    Hostname,distro,KernelVersion,DiskUsage,InterfaceInformation,RrouteInformation,BridgeInformation,KVM machines list
